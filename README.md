# NovoNordisk-Obesity

Project was developed during The Data Analytics Challenge 2022 in Copenhagen with Novo Nordisk and Inviso by Devoteam, 06-7.11.2022.

Background:
Novo Nordisk is a global healthcare company, founded in 1923 and headquartered just out- side Copenhagen, Denmark. Novo Nordisk is raising their ambitions to drive change through the development of a new program that can create significant societal impact by focusing on the prevention of obesity among children (age 5 – 9) and adolescents (age 10 – 19) in selected countries across the world.

Obesity - Drivers and relevance:
As with many chronic diseases, obesity is more prevalent among people with lower socioeconomic status. This is due to unequal distribution of access to health care, healthy food, and physical activity opportunities.

THE CASE


GIVEN DATA
We were provided data in two different categories:
Overweight and Obesity data
Social, educational, economic, cultural, and environmental factors data
OUR SOLUTION
We concluded that Novo Nordisk should launch the program in Malaysia.
We filtered the data using Python.
We started off by narrowing it down by looking at children with highest BMI rate & having a population higher than 1 million.
We looked at 4 external factors when determining which country to choose;
The projected obesity rate 2030
Education Levels Enrollment
Healthy Diet Costs
Broadband and Mobile Subscriptions
We finally displayed and visualised the data using Tableau.
The suggested program to launch in Malaysia
A comprehensive education programme:
In schools – targeting the youngest (5-9 y/o) - where prevalence of obesity is highest
In urban, rather than rural, environments – where obesity rates are highest
Targeting families in the bottom quartile of household income – where obesity rates are highest
In ethnically and culturally appropriate ways - targeting ethnic groups where obesity rates are highest
For parents:
Nudging personal decision-making around diet when the government doesn't make it easy 
Working with local stakeholders – role of 'community pharmacists' in disseminating information
Cost:
Numerous studies across the US and Europe on sustainable programs guiding children towards healthier choices average ~$30 per student, per year
